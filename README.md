# SpaceshipRun
Infinite runner game made with Unity3D

The project is currently not in development due to other priorities, the images were not made by me, I did the code and everything engine related.
This is a work in progress game which feature, multiple vehicles, achievements, "biomes" and some other cool stuff. It's inspired by an old game "DoodleJump".
